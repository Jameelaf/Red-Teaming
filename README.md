### Red Teaming Hands-On Projects

This repository contains a collection of my hands-on red teaming projects focused on offensive security techniques. Each project demonstrates various stages of red team engagements, including reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, and persistence, using industry-standard tools and techniques. 

**Key Areas:**
- Network and Application Exploitation
- Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
- Privilege Escalation
- Persistence Mechanisms
- Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure

These projects highlight real-world attack scenarios and mitigation techniques, showcasing both offensive and defensive security insights.
